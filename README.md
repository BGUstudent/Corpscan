# Corpscan

This is my contribution to Corpscan projet.
I had to implement some back-end features.
Warning :  This was before I discover OOP

Features :
- A Home/login page request a DB (Index.php)
- Different paths according to the users accreditation (Index.php)
- A "forgotten password" feature sending a new password to the user email and changing it in the DB (Forgotten_Password.php)
- Every page can be translated using a simple button (translate.php + headers)

Admin features :
- A "company select" menu 
- The possibility for admins to add new users through a form, which is different according to the company (Sign_Up_Admin.php)
- Or by importing CSV files (Import_CSV.php)
- A logout button
